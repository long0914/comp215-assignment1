# JavaScript Loops

Create an HTML document called assignment1.html that implements a webpage that
dynamically creates (using JavaScript code) a 10X10 HTML table and displays in each
cell the value of row times the column to create a multiplication table. Allow the user to
select the number of rows and columns to redraw a new table.
Follow these guidelines to implement your assignment:

1. Create a JavaScript file called assignment1.js and write the code for a function that draws the table.
2. Invoke the function when the visitor clicks on the assignment1.html page.
3. Load the assignment1.js file at the end of the body in assignment1.html.
4. (10% of the grade) Accept user input for the number of rows and columns in the table.
5. (10% of the grade) Use good web design practices to enhance visually your html page. Add a title, picture, colors, copyright line, etc.
